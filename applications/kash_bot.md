# üìù Kash

## üåü Project Overview

- Name and one-liner of the project: Kash - Your Friendly AI-Powered Prediction Markets Crypto Buddy On X
  
- Description: Kash enables users to effortlessly place bets on the outcome of future events, directly from a simple X post. ElizaOS and Mira Network are used to digest market signals to create new trending markets and to perfectly target the right X thread at the right time to ensure maximum user kick and engagement. Equally, Kash is building the first zkTLS <> AI oracle network to resolve markets immediately, in a decentralised and trustless manner - three of the biggest challenges stopping prediction markets from becoming the next big thing. At the core of Kash, there is Polkadot, to ensure millions of users deposit USDT on the biggest prediction markets, with Kash understanding and executing user intents from a simple post, automatically, fully effortlessly and seamlessly. Before, PayPal changed the game with email-based payment systems. Today, Kash is redifining SocialFi with a simple post - poised for viral growth.

- Polkadot integration: Kash integrates seamlessly into Polkadot as a Substrate-based parachain, leveraging Polkadot‚Äôs shared security and XCM interoperability to enhance its AI-driven prediction markets. Built natively on Polkadot, Kash taps into Phala Network‚Äôs off-chain compute for its ElizaOS AI and aligns its zkTLS oracles and ZKML resolution with Polkadot‚Äôs zero-knowledge focus (e.g., JAM protocol). It can pull liquidity from Acala or data via Acurast, showcasing Polkadot‚Äôs flexibility for complex DeFi primitives. For Polkadot, Kash introduces a socially-driven use case‚Äîprediction markets with social media integration‚Äîboosting retail adoption, ecosystem liquidity, and technical innovation in AI and ZK domains - it effectively has the power to bring million of X users seamlessly onto Polkadot. 
  
- Kash-team-fit: Kash is built upon two main pillars that the team profoundly believes in. Firstly, the unequivocal human right to permissionlessly participate in prediction markets to yield an accurate public good, and, secondly, the team's certainty and vision of the future of retail finance being fully embedded into social media and running on cryptorails. Finally, the team includes the nerdiest of cryptographers (zkp experts), blocklchain security hackers (DeFi focused) together with the most degen of crypto / web3 B2C marketers.
